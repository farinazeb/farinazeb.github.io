This folder is a ready-to-publish static website for En’Chant Studio, using your provided logo.

## Publish for free with GitHub Pages (no coding required)

1. Create a GitHub account (if needed).
2. Create a new repository named:
   - **enchantsudio** (any name is fine), OR for the cleanest free URL:
   - **<your-username>.github.io**
3. Upload these files/folders into the repository:
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `logo.png`
4. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: `main` and `/ (root)`
   - Save
5. Your site will be available at:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`
   - If your repo is named `<your-username>.github.io`, it will be:
     `https://<your-username>.github.io/`

## Edit text
Open `index.html` and change any wording. Styling is in `styles.css`.

## Add a booking button
Once you choose a booking link (Calendly/Square/Acuity), replace the “Inquire / Book” button link in `index.html`
(search for `href="#contact"` near the top).
