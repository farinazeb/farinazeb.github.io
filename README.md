# En’Chant Studio — Preview-Matching GitHub Pages Site

This version matches the preview layout:
- Cloudy pastel background
- Centered logo + buttons
- “What to Expect” section with 3 image cards

## Publish
Upload everything to your GitHub repo, then Settings → Pages → main / root.

## Important
The site uses relative paths like `./assets/logo.png` to work for both:
- USERNAME.github.io (user site)
- USERNAME.github.io/repo (project site)
